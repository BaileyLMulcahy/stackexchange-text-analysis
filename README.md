## Project Overview

This project explores the **Personal Finance & Money StackExchange site** using text-based data analysis and visualisation techniques.

The site contains a large volume of user-generated text and structured interactions, making it an excellent target for data cleansing, transformation, and exploratory analysis.

I processed over **1 GB of XML data** and converted it into CSV format for analysis in Python. This project demonstrates my ability to work with non-trivial data formats, perform data wrangling, apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and create clear, insightful visualisations.

## How to View

This project was completed in Quarto Markdown (.qmd) and converted to PDF. The PDF presents the complete project, while the raw code can be viewed in the .qmd file included.

## Tools & Techniques

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TF-IDF Vectorisation (scikit-learn)
- Quarto Markdown (.qmd) for integrated analysis & reporting
- PDF report generation

---

## Process

1. Programmatically convert StackExchange XML files to CSV using a custom Python function
2. Load and explore data using Pandas
3. Perform text analysis and generate visualisations
4. Summarise insights and conclusions

---

## Key Visualisations

- **Top 20 Most Common Tags**
- **Tag Co-occurrence Heatmap**
- **Top 10 Users by Post Count**
- **User Reputation vs Post Count (Top 100 users)**
- **Posts Mentioning "Tax" or "Loan" in Titles**
- **Timeline of "Tax" Mentions**
- **Timeline of Total Posts**
- **Votes Over Time by Type**
- **Distribution of Comment Lengths**
- **TF-IDF Analysis of Post Titles**

---

## Key Insights

- "United-states" and "taxes" are the most popular tags and frequently co-occur
- Higher post count generally correlates with higher user reputation
- Posting activity peaked between 2015-2019
- Upvotes far outnumber downvotes and follow the same activity trends as posting volume
- The most frequent comment length is ~100 characters
- Tax-related discussions are highly prominent based on TF-IDF scores

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my skills in working with unstructured data formats, performing data cleansing and transformation, applying text-based exploratory data analysis (EDA), and producing clear visual reports.

Further improvements could include deeper NLP (e.g. sentiment analysis) and interactive dashboards to enhance user engagement.

## Future Work

- Deeper NLP (e.g. sentiment analysis)
- Topic modelling to identify emerging themes
- Interactive dashboards for dynamic exploration
